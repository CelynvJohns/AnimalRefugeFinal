			The Animal Rescue League of Des Moines was founded in 1995 by a group of animal lovers who were concerned about the homeless and abandoned animals in our community.
			We started out as a small shelter, but we have grown over the years to become a leading provider of animal welfare services in the region.
			Since it's opening the Animal Rescue League has placed an estimated 65,000 homeless cats and dogs in new households.

			Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome animals in need. Our values are compassion, respect, and responsibility.
			We believe that every animal deserves a loving home, and we are committed to doing everything we can to make that happen.
